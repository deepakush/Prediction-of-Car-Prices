# Prediction-of-Car-Prices
Build, Develop and Deploy a Machine Learning Model to predict cars price using Linear Regression. To understand the factors on which the pricing of cars depends for aspire to enter the current market businesses

1. Understanding the Data

2. Data cleaning

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

4. Data Preparation

5. Model Building

6. Prediction and Evaluation

Go through in brife way
* After the Data Extraction and Data Preprocessing steps, I should now visualize my data set so that I can have more insights about what is happening under the hood, and how my data is distributed.
  In the following section, I will run a Q&A session in order to answer many questions based on histograms & plot.
* Cleaning data is not the most exciting job, but we were introduced to Dataprep! This is a fantastic tool available on GCP for data cleaning and preparation. 
  It let us concentrate on concepts instead of implementation. If you are fine coding your way out for preprocessing, then it wonâ€™t bring you much benefit. 
  However, if you have different levels of coding skills within your team, Dataprep allows anyone contribute to the solution and then migrate the logic and concepts, already validated, to production ready code.
* Now we came to the main task in all this process, which is Data Modeling, for this purpose I will use 4 Machine Learning models dedicated for Regression problems, at the end I will do a Benchmarking table to compare each model r2_score and select the best one. The used models are : Multiple Linear Regression
